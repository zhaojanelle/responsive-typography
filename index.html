      <h1>The Myth of Osiris</h1>
      <p>Summarized by Plutarch</p>
    </header>
    <p>Nut, the sky-goddess, was the wife of Ra. She was, however, beloved by Geb, whose affection she returned. When Ra discovered his wife’s infidelity he was wrathful indeed, and pronounced a curse upon her, saying that her child should not be born in any month or in any year. Now the curse of Ra the mighty could not be turned aside, for Ra was the chief of all the gods.</p>
    <p>In her distress Nut called upon the god Thoth, who also loved her. Thoth knew that the curse of Ra must be fulfilled, yet by a very cunning stratagem he found a way out of the difficulty. He went to Silene, the moon-goddess, whose light rivalled that of the sun himself, and challenged her to a game of tables. The stakes on both sides were high, but Silene staked some of her light, the seventieth part of each of her illuminations, and lost.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><span class="quote">“</span>Ra was swallowed every night by the sky goddess Nut, and was reborn every morning.<span class="quote">”</span></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Thus it came about that her light wanes and dwindles at certain periods, so that she is no longer the rival of the sun. From the light which he had won from the moon-goddess Thoth made five days which he added to the year (at that time consisting of three hundred and sixty days) in such wise that they belonged neither to the preceding nor to the following year, nor to any month.</p>
    <p>On these five days Nut was delivered of her five children.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Osiris was born on the first day,</li>
      <li>Horus on the second,</li>
      <li>Set on the third,</li>
      <li>Isis on the fourth,</li>
      <li>and Nephthys on the fifth.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>On the birth of Osiris a loud voice was heard throughout all the world saying, “The lord of all the earth is born!”</p>
